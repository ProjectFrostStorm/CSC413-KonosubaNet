"Satou Kazuma-san, welcome to the afterlife. Unfortunately, you've died. It might've been short, but your life's now over."
Someone suddenly spoke to me in a pure white room.
The sudden turn of events confused me.
In the room was an office desk and a chair, and the one who announced that my life was over sat on said chair.
If there was a goddess, she had to be it.
Her beauty was beyond the idols shown on television; she had a glamour that surpassed humans.
She had long, silky smooth blue hair.
She seemed to be about my age.
She wasn't too busty nor too lacking, and had a light-purple hagoromo draped over her clothes.
The beauty blinked her eyes, which were the same aqua-blue colour as her hair, and stared at me as I tried to figure out what was going on.
… I thought about what had happened moments ago.
… I usually coop myself up at home, so it was rare for me to go outside.
To purchase a limited first-release version of a popular online game, I got up early to queue up.
Society addressed people like me as a 'hikikomori'.
After buying the game, it was time to return home to play to my heart's content. I was in a great mood as I anticipated this while walking home,, but at that moment…
A girl was looking down on her cell phone and walking before me.
From her uniform, she would've been studying at the same school as me.
After seeing the lights turn green, the girl didn't check traffic and crossed the road immediately.
A large shadow loomed toward her.
It had to have been a large truck heading toward her at high speed.
When I came to my senses, I'd knocked the girl away.
After that…
… Mysteriously calm, I asked the beauty before me:
"… May I ask one thing?"
The beauty nodded in response to my question.
"Please, go ahead."
"… The girl that was knocked away by me, is she still alive?"
That was the most important thing.
That was the first and last time I'd done something worthwhile.
If I hadn't managed to save her in time despite betting my life, that would've been frustrating.
"She lives! But she fractured her leg."
Thank goodness.
I didn't die in vain; I did something good at the very end.
Seeing me acting relieved, the beauty tilted her head and said:
"But, she wouldn't have been hurt if you hadn't knocked her away."
"… Huh?"
What'd she say?
"The tractor would've stopped before hitting the girl. I mean, it was just a slow tractor after all. That means that your unnecessary meddling by acting like a hero made things worse… Puhehe!"
What's with this? This was the first time I met this girl.
It might've been rude, but I felt like beating her up.
… Wait, hold it. I thought I heard something more important just nowthat was .
"… What'd you say? A tractor? Not a truck?"
"That's right, a tractor. If a truck had been speeding toward that girl, she would've noticed it and gotten away."
… Huh?
"Eh, but what about me? Did I die after getting hit by the tractor?"
"No, you died from shock. You thought you were ran over by a truck and went into shock. I've been doing this for a long time, but you're the first to die in such a hilarious way!"
"……"
"Because of your close call with the tractor, you lost consciousness and control of your bowels, and you were sent to a nearby hospital. As the doctors and nurses were laughing and saying, 'What's with this guy, how useless–', you didn't regain consciousness and your heart failed."
"Shut up–! I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear something so humiliating!"
The girl walked to my side as I cupped my ears and smiled deviously, leaning close to my ears.
"Your family reached the hospital, but before they could feel the sadness from their loss, they couldn't help but burst into laughter upon hearing your cause of death."
"Shut up, shut up! This can't be real! How can there be such a useless way to die? This is unbelievable!"
Looking down at me squatting with my head in my arms, the girl covered her mouth and laughed.
"… Well, that ends my de-stressing session. This is our first meeting, Satou Kazuma-san. My name's Aqua. I'm a goddess that guides young people who die in Japan. Now, putting aside how funny your demise was, you now have two options."
… This girl!
Forget it, being worked up would just delay the progress of the conversation; I just need to bear with it.
"The first option would be reincarnating and beginning a new life; the other option would be staying in a place sort of like heaven and living the life of a retirement home."
What a lazy way to describe the options.
"Eh, well, how's the place that's sort of like heaven? More importantly, what do you mean by 'retirement home'?"
"Heaven isn't as great as you humans would imagine. You don't need to eat after dying and won't be able to make any food naturally; there aren't any ingredients nor necessities for you to use anyway. I'm sorry if I disappointed you, but there's nothing in heaven. No television, no manga and no games. Only other people that've died before you. Moreover, since you're dead, you can't do anything kinky. You can't since you don't even have a body. The only thing you can do is bask in the sun with your predecessors and chat. Forever."
No computer games and no entertainment? Rather than heaven, that'd be closer to hell.
However, to become a baby and restart my life…
No, that was the only option.
Looking at my disappointed face, the goddess smiled and said:
"Hey… You don't want to go to a boring place like heaven, right? However, asking you to let go of all of your memories and start again as a baby's the same as erasing your existence, since your memories will be gone. And so, I've great news for you!"
For some reason I was skeptical.
Aqua said to the wary me with a smile,
"Do you like games?"
Aqua confidently explained her so-called good news.
This was the gist of it:
In a world different from where I was, there was another world with a Demon King.
In addition, with the attack of the Demon King's army, that world fell into crisis.
There were magic and monsters in that world.
To put it simply, it was a fantasy world like the famous games Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.
"The people who died in that world were killed by the Demon King's army and were very afraid, saying that they didn't want to die like that again. Therefore, almost all of the people who died rejected reincarnating in that world again. More specifically, that world will end if this continues since babies will cease to be born there. Hence, we'll solve that problem by sending the dead from other worlds over, right? That's how it is."
What a sloppy immigration policy.
"And since we're sending people over, we should find people that've died young and still yearn to live and send them over with their original body and memories. It'll be meaningless if they were to die immediately after going over, so we'll grant a privilege to all of those going to that world, allowing them to take one thing they like. It may be a powerful ability, an exceptional talent or a god-level weapon. What do you think? It might be another world, but you can live once more. For the people of that world, someone will appear who can fight immediately. How about it? Isn't this great news?"
I see, it did sound great.
To be honest, this made me excited.
I knew I liked games, but I never would've imagined that I'd be able to enter a world that was just like my favourite computer games.
However, before that.
"Um, I have a question, what about the language? Will I be able to speak the language of the other world?"
"This isn't a problem. With the gentle aid of the gods, knowledge of the language will be beamed directly into your brain the moment you head over to the other world. You'll even be able to read! As a side effect, your brain might be wiped blank if you're unlucky… Anyway, all that's left is to choose a powerful ability or weapon."
"Hold on, I heard something important just now. Did you say my brain might be wiped blank if I'm unlucky?"
"I didn't say that."
"You did."
The tension from earlier was gone. I was speaking to a goddess, but my attitude was akin to speaking to an equal.
… Nevertheless, that was an attractive proposition.
It was scary to know that there's a chance in wiping my brain blank, but I'm not bragging when I say that I've been confident in my luck ever since I was young.
At this moment, Aqua showed me something like a catalogue.
"Please choose. I may grant you one and only one power. It may be a powerful unique ability, or perhaps a legendary weapon. Come, it can be anything. You have the privilege to bring this one thing to the other world."
After hearing Aqua's explanation, I took the catalogue and started browsing it.
… On it was, 'Unnatural Strength,' 'Super Magic,' 'Holy Sword Arondight,' 'Demon Sword Murasame,' and all sorts of names.
I got it; choose an ability or weapon to bring along.
How troubling, having too many choices is making me indecisive.
Or rather, my gamer instincts told me that these were cheat-like abilities and equipment.
How troubling, how troubling… Since I'd be going to a world with magic, I really wanted to try using magic.
Hence, I should choose an ability based on magic…
"Hey, hurry up. It doesn't matter which one you choose, nobody's expecting much of a hikikomori gaming otaku. Can you just pick one and be on your way? Anything will do. Hurry up, hurry up…"
"I-I'm not an otaku…! And I died outside, so I'm not a hikikomori…!"
I answered in a trembling voice, but Aqua simply toyed with the ends of her hair and told me disinterestedly:
"It doesn't matter, just hurry up and choose. There are still many dead souls waiting in line!"
Aqua sat on her chair as she spoke, munching on her snacks without even looking at me.
… This girl, mocking my cause of death even though it was the first time we'd met. Acting so stuck up just because she was pretty…
Aqua's can't-be-bothered attitude made me mad.
You want me to choose quickly, right?
Then I'll do just that.
Something I may bring to that world.
"… Okay, I choose you!"
I pointed at Aqua and said.
Aqua looked at me surprised for a moment and continued munching on her snacks.
"Ah, okay, please stand there and don't move out of the magic circle…"
Aqua suddenly stopped talking.
"… What'd you just say?"
In the next moment.
"I understand. Well then, I'll take over Aqua-sama's job from now on."
With a flash of white light, a winged woman appeared out of nowhere.
… Simply put, it was a woman that looked like an angel.
"… Eh?"
As Aqua squealed in surprise, a blue magic circle appeared under her feet, and under my feet as well.
Oh, what was this?
Am I really going to another world?
"Wait…! Huh, what's happening? Eh, you can't be serious! No! No…! Hold on! This is too weird! Isn't it cheating to bring a goddess along? This shouldn't count! Wait! Wait, okay?"
Aqua panicked with tears in her eyes; she was a mess.
The angel spoke while facing Aqua:
"Have a safe trip, Aqua-sama. Please leave the rest to me. We'll send envoys to welcome you back right after the Demon King's defeated. Before you return, I'll handle all of your tasks."
"Wait! Wait! I may have the ability to heal as a goddess, but I have no combat ability to speak of! It's impossible for me to defeat the Demon King!"
The angel who appeared suddenly ignored Aqua, who collapsed on the floor crying, and smiled gently at me.
"Satou Kazuma-san, you'll be heading to another world now and will become one of the hero candidates to defeat the Demon King. You'll receive a gift from the gods the moment you defeat the Demon King."
"… Gift?"
I asked by repeating what she said.
The angel smiled warmly at me.
"That's right, a gift befitting the saviour of the world… You'll be granted a wish; it may be anything you want."
"Oh!"
That means that I could wish to return to Japan if I ever grew tired of that world.
For example, returning to Japan after growing tired of that world, becoming rich and spending all day playing video games while surrounded by ladies! Even such a decadent dream's possible!
"Wait! Giving that cool speech is my job!"
Aqua wailed on the floor after the angel took her job.
I was satisfied after seeing Aqua act this way.
Therefore, I pointed at Aqua and said:
"How does it feel to be companions with a man you look down on? Hey, you're the 'thing' I've chosen to bring along! Since you're a goddess, use your godly powers to make my adventure a breeze!"
"No! Going to another world with a man like this, no way…!"
"Hero, may you be victorious among the many hero candidates and be the one to defeat the Demon King…! Well then, I bid you farewell!"
"Wah! That's my line!"
With the announcement from the angel…!
A bright light surrounded the wailing Aqua and me…!

A carriage made a loud creaking sound as it drove over the pavement.
"…Another world… Hey, it really is another world. Eh, it's for real. Am I going to use magic and go on adventures in this world?"
Trembling with excitement because of the scene before me, I started talking to myself.
Before my eyes were houses built from red bricks, the streets right out of Europe from the middle ages.
There were no cars, bikes, power lines, or telecommunication cables.
"AHHH! …AHHH…!"
I looked around the street, watching people pass by.
"Animal ears! There's someone with animal ears! Elf ears! Is that an elf? With such striking facial features, she definitely has to be one! Goodbye hikikomori life! Hello different world! If it's this world, then I'm willing to go out and work obediently!"
"AHHH! …AHHH! …AHHH…!"
I turned around and looked at Aqua, who was hugging her head and screaming.
"Hey, you're noisy. What would you do if people think I'm friends with a crazy woman like you? Stop screaming. You should be giving something to me at a time like this. Look at what I'm wearing. A tracksuit? I've finally arrived in a fantasy world and I'm wearing a tracksuit. According to the norm in games, you should be giving me the minimum equipment…"
"AHHH–!"
The goddess screamed as she pounced over to grab me.
"Whoa! What…? What are you doing, don't act this way! I get it! I'll do something about the basic equipment. I should say that I was wrong. If you hate it that much, you can go back. I'll work out the rest on my own."
Aqua tried to strangle me with teary eyes, so I shook off her hands and tried to shoo her away with an annoyed expression.
In the end, Aqua said with trembling hands:
"What are you saying? I'm troubled because I can't go back! What now? Hey, what should I do? What am I going to do from now on?"
Aqua fell into a panic in tears, pacing about while hugging her head.
Her waist-length hair was a mess. She looked crazy right now, although she was a beauty if she didn't speak.
"Hey, calm down, goddess, the first place to visit should be the tavern. Everything starts from collecting information at a tavern, that's the standard in RPGs."
"Huh…? You're supposed to be just a hikikomori-gaming NEET,  so why are you so reliable? Ah, Kazuma, my name's Aqua. I don't mind you addressing me as goddess, but do call me by my name whenever possible or else citizens will surround us and we won't be able to go on adventures and take down the Demon King. This might be a different world, but I'm still one of the revered gods in it."
Aqua confidently said as she followed behind me.
All right, there should be a group formed to take on the Demon King or an adventurer's guild made to defeat monsters.
Speaking of which, Aqua was a goddess. Therefore, I could ask her if I had any questions.
"Aqua, please tell me where the adventurer's guild is. Which way should we go?"
I asked Aqua, but she just looked at me blankly.
"…? I wouldn't know even if you ask me. I know the common knowledge of this world, but not the specifics of this town. This is just one of the many existing planets, and just a small town at that! How should I know?"
This girl's useless.
There was no other way, so I asked a middle-aged lady passing by.
I didn't ask any guys for fear of meeting delinquents, and the difficulty of talking to young girls is too high for me.
"Excuse me–may I ask you something? I'm looking for a place like an adventurer's guild…"
"Guild? Oh my, to not know where the guild is, might you be from out of town?"
From what the lady said there really was a guild here, making me relieved.
"That's right; I'm a traveller who came from a faraway land. I just reached this town."
"Oh my… Since you came to this town, you must be aiming to become an adventurer. Welcome to the town of novice adventurers, Axel. Follow the main road and turn right, you'll then see the signboard for the guild."
"Take a right down the road. Got it, thank you very much! … Hey, let's go."
A town for novice adventurers.
I see. This was a good starting point for the dead transported here.
After thanking the lady, I followed her directions while Aqua followed me with respect in her eyes and sighed.
"Hey, you came up with an excuse right on the spot. Why are you able to handle this so perfectly? You seem to be a capable guy, so why were you a hikiNEET without any friends or a girlfriend? Why would you want to stay at home all day and be a hikiNEET?"
"Not having friends or a girlfriend isn't a bad thing. One can't measure the value of a person by the number of friends or by having a significant other. Moreover, don't call me a hikiNEET you damn bitch! Don't combine hikikomori and NEET together…! I'm just sixteen; I'm too young to be a NEET by society's standards…! There it is."
Aqua pounced over to strangle me for calling her a bitch, but I ignored her and entered the adventurer's guild.
– Adventurer's Guild –
A place for adventurers to take up quests which was a staple in games; an organization that supports the adventurers.
The job agency of this world.
There was a rather large establishment before us, and the fragrance of food drifted from within.
Some rough characters would certainly be inside.
They might find trouble with me if they see unfamiliar faces.
After preparing myself mentally and entering…
"Ah, welcome. Please approach the counter if you're looking for quests. If you're here to dine, then please take any empty seat…!"
A waitress with short red hair received us warmly.
The slightly dim interior seemed to double as a bar.
Seen congregating inside were groups of men in armor, but they didn't seem to bear ill will.
However, unfamiliar faces seems to be rare, as everyone was focusing on us.
… I realized why they were looking this way.
"Hey, they're looking this way too blatantly. It must be the holy aura coming from me; they must've discovered that I'm a goddess."
The reason was the appearance of the goddess speaking dumb words.
She was a beauty as long as she didn't speak, after all, so everyone's eyes were attracted to her.
For now, I ignored their gazes and went about my original objective.
"… Listen carefully, Aqua… They'll give us a tutorial if we register, enabling us to earn a living; that's the kind of place adventurer guilds are. We should be able to take out a loan to prepare ourselves, complete simple jobs to get by and introduce ourselves to a good tavern. Most games start out this way. Normally, preparing the minimum essentials to live in this world should be your job, but never mind that. For today, let's register with the guild, get some equipment and money, and find a place to sleep."
"I don't care about that. My job's sending the dead to this world, but I get it. I'm not familiar with games, but what you said seems to be common sense for this world. So I just need to register to be an adventurer too, right?"
"That's right. All right then, let's go."
Taking Aqua with me, I made a beeline for the counter.
There were four counter staff members.
Two of them were female.
I queued up at the counter with the prettier lady.
"… Hey, the other three counters are empty. Why are you queuing here? We won't have to wait if we go to another counter… Ah, because this counter worker's the prettiest, huh? Really, I was a bit impressed and thought that you were reliable just now, but you're really doing this?"
Aqua, who was following me, didn't seem to know anything, so I whispered to her quietly:
"Building a good rapport with the guild's counter staff are the basics, and the pretty counter lady definitely has plenty of flags to raise. This means that there'll be more shocking hidden side quests waiting for us. For example, the counter lady might be a powerful adventurer or something."
"… Now that you mention it, I saw something similar in a manga. Sorry, I'll wait in line obediently."
Because we didn't approach the other empty counters and intentionally queued here, the other staff people were looking at us curiously. Nevertheless, I decided to pretend not to notice.
It was finally our turn.
"Good morning, how may I help you?"
The counter worker was a gentle beauty.
Her wavy hair and large breasts made her look mature.
"Eh, I want to become an adventurer. I come from the countryside and don't know anything…"
If I tell the counter worker that I come from the countryside or a faraway nation, they'll give a more thorough explanation.
"I see. There'll be a registration fee, will that be okay?"
That's right this was the basic tutorial.
I would just need to follow the instructions of the counter worker…
… Registration fee?
"… Hey Aqua, got any cash on you?"
"I was transported here suddenly, so how would it be possible for me to have any money?"
… How can this be, shouldn't they loan some money to us or put it on a tab for now?
I moved away from the counter and discussed strategy with Aqua.
"… Hey, what now? We're in a pinch right from the beginning. In games, you'll normally get starting equipment, as well as some money for living expenses."
"You suddenly become unreliable. However, there's no helping it, since you're a hikikomori after all. All right, it's time for me to shine. Just watch, I'll show you the capability of a goddess."
Seated at a table wearing the loose and cumbersome clothing of a priest was a man.
Aqua approached the man confidently…
"Man of the cloth, please state thy religion! I'm Aqua. That's right, the goddess Aqua worshipped by the religious order of Axis! If thou art a believer…! … May you give me some aid by lending me some money?"
With an attitude that seemed lofty yet humble, she asked him for money.
"… I'm from the Eris Sect."
"Ah… I see, sorry…"
I didn't get it, but they seem to be from different religious orders.
As the dejected Aqua was preparing to come back, the priest stopped her.
"Ah… Madam, you must be a follower of Axis. There were stories about Goddess Aqua and Goddess Eris being close, so this must be fate. I've been observing you. Might you be having trouble paying the registration fee? It's just a small fee, so please take it as a blessing from Goddess Eris. But no matter how devout you are, you shouldn't use the title of goddess in vain."
"Ah… Okay, sorry… Thank you very much…"
The eyes of Aqua looked dead as she returned with the money.
"Ha, he didn't believe that I'm a goddess… By the way, Goddess Eris's my junior. I was pitied by the believer of my junior goddess and received his money…"
"What matters is that you completed the task. Think about it. If he really believed that you were a goddess, there'd be a different kind of trouble!"
Aqua had an expression that seemed to say she lost something important, so I half-heartedly encouraged her.
"Eh, we're back with the registration fees."
"I… I see… The registration fee is 1,000 eris…"
Aqua received 3,000 eris from the priest.
According to Aqua, one eris was about one yen. Therefore, she received about 3,000 yen.
The counter lady didn't interfere with the commotion we stirred up, but was unwilling to look both of us in the eye.
It seemed that I'd broken the flag between this lady and me.
"All right. Since you said you want to become an adventurer, you should have some level of understanding, but I'll explain it from the start… First, adventurers are responsible for the extermination of monsters wandering outside the town, people who get rid of dangerous creatures that might harm the citizens. They're also jacks-of-all-trades, taking on odd jobs that require their talents. Collectively known as adventurers are people who earn a living this way. And among adventurers, there are different jobs."
Finally, it was coming.
This was a norm for adventurers. Be it jobs, class, or whatever it's called, you had to choose the way you fought in this world.
Compared to the blunt warrior profession, flashy jobs like mages should be better.
The counter lady handed Aqua and I one card each.
It was about the size of a driver's license and seemed to be a kind of identification card.
"Please look over here; do you see the word 'Level'? As both of you know, all things in the world have souls no matter what form it takes. If you eat or kill a being, you can absorb a part of the memory of the soul, known as 'Experience Points.'
"Experience Points are normally intangible things, but…"
The counter lady pointed to one part of the card and continued.
"With this card, the Experience Points the adventurer absorbs will be shown here. At the same time, the level corresponding to your experience points will be displayed here. This shows how strong an adventurer is. How many enemies you defeat will be recorded here. With the accumulation of experience points, all creatures will grow stronger rapidly at some point, known as leveling up. Simply put, leveling up will grant you all sorts of benefits, such as skill points to learn new skills. So please work hard to increase your level."
After listening to the explanation, I recalled something Aqua said.
She asked me, "Do you like games?"
I got it. After listening to all that, this world was just like a game.
"First, please fill in your height, weight, age and other details in the blanks."
I filled in my measurements on the form given to me by the counter lady.
Height was 165 cm (5 ft., 5 in), weight 55 kg (121 lbs.). Sixteen years old, black hair and eyes…
"That'll be fine, please touch this card. This will display the strength of each of your abilities for reference when choosing your job. After accumulating skill points, you can learn skills that are available for your job. This is one of the key points in choosing occupations."
Oh, it was time for this.
The time to show my amazing potential and create a big commotion in the guild.
With tense emotions and a heart full of expectation, I touched the card.
"… All right, thank you. Satou Kazuma-san, right? Let's see… Strength, vitality, magic, agility and speed… All of them are average. Intelligence is slightly better than average… Huh? Luck's very high, but it's not very relevant for adventurers… This is troubling. From the numbers, you can only choose the most basic Adventurer job! Since your luck's so high, I suggest you give up being an adventurer and be a merchant instead… What'll you like to do?"
Hey, denying my life of adventuring right from the very start!? What was this?
The corners of Aqua's lips were high in a smile, tempting me to punch her.
My being weak doesn't help your cause, you know.
"Um… I'd like to become an Adventurer…"
The counter lady said with a face of worry:
"I-It's fine. After levelling up and raising your stats, you can change your job! In addition, the Adventurer job is just what it sounds like; it's a combination of all jobs. That's right, it might be a basic level job, but it doesn't mean it's worse than the others! Adventurers can learn and use the skills of all jobs after all!"
"On the other hand, you'll need more skill points to learn skills. Without the bonus attribute of the actual job, your skills will be weaker when compared to them. It's a jack of all trades, master of none."
After the counter lady pointed out the good points, Aqua immediately shot them down.
I should find a place to throw her away.
It seemed that I would be taking a basic job, a beginner job.
Anyway, it was the weakest job.
However, I was still an adventurer that appeared in this world.
As I received my card with my name and the job 'Adventurer' written on it with a heavy heart…
"Eh? Huh? What's with these numbers? Leaving the lower than average intelligence and rock bottom luck aside, the rest of your stats drastically exceed the average! Especially your magic, it's abnormally high! Who in the world are you…?"
The counter lady screamed after looking at the card Aqua touched.
The place was in an uproar.
… Weird, shouldn't that be happening to me instead?
"Ah, is that right? Therefore, it means I'm amazing. Oh my, it's normal by my standard."
No matter how useless, she was still a goddess.
However, Aqua being so happy that she became embarrassed pissed me off.
"This… This is way beyond amazing! Mage-type jobs that require high intelligence aren't available… However, you may choose any other job! The holy knight with its strongest defense, Crusader; the swordsman with the strongest attack, Sword Master; and the top-tier cleric, Archpriest. You may choose from most of the top-tier jobs right now!"
Slightly troubled by the counter lady's exclamation, Aqua said:
"Well, it's a pity that goddess isn't available as a job. It'll be Archpriest for me then."
"Archpriest! Archpriests can use all kinds of recovery and support spells. They can even take the role of vanguards, a strong all-rounder job! I'll register you now… Done. Welcome to the adventurer's guild, Aqua-sama! All of our staff look forward to your grand exploits!"
The counter lady said with a pleasant smile.
… Strange, what was this?
As I said, this should've happened to me…
Ah, forget it–
With that, my life as an adventurer began in this world.

"All right, good work everyone–! That's it for today! Here, this is today's salary."
"Thank you! Good job today, boss–!"
"Good job–!"
After the boss announced the end of the workday, Aqua and I received our salary, bowed and thanked him.
"Everyone, we'll make a move first–!"
"Goodbye–!"
"Oh–thanks for your hard work! I'm counting on you tomorrow too."
I bid farewell to my seniors while Aqua followed my lead.
After hearing the reply from the seniors, Aqua and I left the workplace.
Ah, I worked the whole of today too.
Even I was beginning to doubt that I was ever a hikikomori.
Aqua and I took our salary for the day and headed for the public bath.
The public bath was no different from the ones in Japan.
Judging from the average salary, the entrance fee was higher than Japan's. However, I couldn't change the habit of taking a bath after finishing work.
"Ah, I'm alive again…"
I soaked my shoulders in the warm water, leisurely relieving my fatigue from work.
This place seemed to be from the middle ages, so I thought it would've been luxurious to take a bath here, but that was just me.
I was grateful, so grateful…!
After leaving the bath, I saw Aqua waiting for me at the entrance.
Bathing longer than a girl was a bit off-putting, but that was the nature of the Japanese.
"What would you like to eat today? I want some smoked-lizard hamburger steak and the heart-freezing crimson Neroid!"
"I want to eat meat too, so let's go to the tavern and get two smoked-lizard steak set meals."
"Agreed!"
After finishing our meal, Aqua and I didn't have anything to do and went to the stables.
After picking hay not stained by horse manure to make a bed, we laid down immediately.
Aqua was sleeping beside me as usual.
"Well then, good night."
"Good night. Phew… I worked hard today too…"
With that, I drifted off into dreamland…
"No, wait a minute!"
I suddenly sat up.
"What is it? Did you forget to go to the washroom? It's dark out there; do you need me to accompany you?"
"No way! Hold on, it's not that. I just realized that we've been living the life of manual labourers so far."
Indeed.
For the past two weeks, Aqua and I have been working on the walls outside the city.
We were construction workers.
That was too far off from the adventurer life I was aspiring to live in this world.
Or rather, why'd Aqua get so used to this lifestyle without any complaints?
Weren't you a goddess?
"You don't work, you don't eat, isn't that obvious? HikiNEETs are fussy. If you prefer to, you can work as a store clerk too!"
"No! It's not that. How should I put this? What I'm after is exciting battles against monsters! A life like that! Moreover, isn't this world in a crisis with the invasion of the Demon King? Isn't it amazingly peaceful here? There are no signs of demons at all!"
I got worked up as I spoke. As my voice grew louder, our neighbours lectured me.
"Hey, can it! Be quiet!"
"Ah, sorry!"
Adventurers who were just starting out were poor.
It was normally impossible for us to rent a room in the tavern every night.
Usually, adventurers would share the rent with other adventurers and sleep in the communal room.
Alternatively, they could do what we were doing and sleep on the hay in the stables.
Yes, this was different from the adventurer lifestyle in an alternate world that I was looking forward to.
Staying in the tavern daily was the same as sleeping in a hotel every day in Japan.
It was impossible for adventurers with an unstable income to do so.
… Indeed, our income wasn't stable.
No simple herb-picking or monster-hunting quests that appeared in games were available.
Monsters didn't burst into loot and money when you killed them.
In addition, the forest near town has long since been cleared of monsters.
The forest had turned safe after the monsters were gone, so no one would hire people to harvest materials for them.
This was obvious.
The outdoors was so safe that the children could roam free.
There were guards manning the gate, but instead of maintaining round-the-clock security, it was easier to exterminate all the dangerous monsters since the forest wasn't too large.
It was the most logical method, but I'd rather not know this.
An adventurer who was just slightly stronger than normal people spending half a day harvesting herbs that were easy to spot and earning enough for food and lodging.
There was no way such an easy job existed.
Japan was a prosperous nation on Earth, but even so, no laborer could live in a hotel on their daily pay.
Minimum wage? Labour laws? What were those? Could we eat them?
That was the kind of world this was.
"It's useless even if you tell me these things. This is the town furthest away from the Demon King's castle after all! Who would come all the way to attack a town of beginners at the borders…? Anyway… Kazuma wants to live more like an adventurer, right? You don't even have the proper equipment!"
Aqua went straight to the point, and I couldn't protest.
That was right, Aqua and I didn't even have a full set of basic equipment. We were hoping to buy them, which was why we were working so hard at the construction site.
"I'm getting bored of construction too. I didn't come to this world to be a labourer; I came to this world with no computers and games to adventure. And didn't you send me here to challenge the Demon King?"
After hearing what I said, Aqua made a 'what are you talking about' face, pondered for a moment, and then responded:
"Oh! There was such a thing! I forgot, immersed in the happiness of working. I can't go back if Kazuma doesn't defeat the Demon King."
Listening to her dumb reply, I recalled the counter lady's words. It seemed that this girl's intelligence really was below average.
"All right, let's go challenge the Demon King! Don't worry; it'll be a breeze with me here! Look forward to my performance!"
"That makes me uneasy… However, you're a goddess after all, so I'm counting on you! Okay, we'll buy some basic weapons and armor with the money we saved and go grinding tomorrow!"
"Leave it to me!"
"Didn't I tell you two to can it? Do you want me to beat you up?"
"I'm very sorry!"
As we apologized to the other adventurers, I got ready to sleep with a heart full of excitement.

– Under the clear blue sky.
"Ah! Help! Aqua, save me…!"
"Puhehe! This is hilarious! Kazuma, your face is all red and you have tears in your eyes! You look really desperate!"
Okay, I'll bury this girl before going back.
As I made up my mind, I continued to run and scream for help as a giant frog-like monster chased me.
This was the open plain outside of town.
We took a quest from the guild in the morning and headed there.
As for the bare minimum weapon needed, I chose a short sword.
Aqua was acting dumb, saying a goddess wielding weapons was unglamorous and wasn't equipped with anything. She was leisurely watching the frogs chase me.
Don't look down on them just because they're frogs.
They were bigger than bulls. It was their mating season, so they were accumulating nutrition to lay eggs. They roamed around human settlements where food was more plentiful, swallowing goats raised by farmers in a single gulp.
If they could swallow a goat whole, swallowing Aqua and me would be easy too.
In fact, children and farmers often went missing during their mating season.
Even though they looked just like frogs, they were still dangerous monsters, stronger than the small and exterminated monsters near town.
By the way, their meat was a bit tough, but it was pleasant and refreshing. A rather popular ingredient.
Their thick fat was effective against blunt attacks.
They hated metals, so they wouldn't hunt you if you were fully equipped. It was an easy foe for normal adventurers.
That was why skilful adventurers like to hunt them, but…
"Aqua–! Aqua–! Stop laughing and save me–!"
"For starters, add a '-san' when you address me."
"Aqua-sama–!"
I'll bury this girl all the way, only leaving her head above ground. I'll let her know the horror of frogs targeting you.
I was on the verge of tears, looking back at the frog hopping behind me.
At this moment, I realized that the frog was heading in a different direction from me.
Before the frog was…
"Can't be helped–! All right, I'll save you, hikiNEET! However, you'll need to worship this goddess from tomorrow onward! You'll have to join the Aqua sect in town and pray to me three times a day! You can't object if I take any side dishes from you during meals! In addition… Ugh?"
Aqua, who had been puffing her chest out and rambling on about something, disappeared.
I turned my head and saw that the frog had stopped moving.
Something blue was dangling from the corner of its mouth.
That blue thing was…
"Aqua–! You…! How could you get eaten–?"
Aqua, eaten by the frog, had one spasming leg dangling out of its mouth.
I drew my short sword and charged at the frog!
"Sob… Ugh, ugh– WAHHH…!"
Covered in sticky frog fluid, Aqua was hugging her knees while sitting on the ground before me, sobbing.
Beside her was the frog, its head smashed in.
"Ugh… Sob… Thank, thank you… Kazuma, thank you…! WAHHH…!"
Aqua had been crying non-stop ever since I dragged her out of the frog's mouth.
Even a goddess couldn't stand the horror of being prey.
"Are… Are you okay, Aqua? Be strong… Let's go back for today. The quest we took on was exterminating five frogs in three days, but they weren't opponents we could handle. Let's try again when we've got better equipment. Look, I only have a short sword, no armor, and I'm still wearing my tracksuit. Let's come back when we're dressed more like adventurers."
To be honest, a novice like me only defeated the frog because it stopped moving as it tried to swallow Aqua.
If the frog had attacked me without hesitation, I wouldn't have had the courage to face it.
Aqua stood up with the glossy fluid all over her body.
"Ugh… For a goddess like me to be humiliated by a frog; how can we retreat? I'm already defiled. If a believer sees how dirty I am… Their faith will most certainly plummet! If people knew that I ran from frogs, it'd be a disgrace to the name of the beautiful Goddess Aqua!"
You didn't have worry about that. You carried several times more construction materials at the work site than the men did, whilst looking happy working. Your greatest joy was eating dinner after taking a bath; you were sleeping so soundly that you even drooled while sleeping in the stables beside me. After seeing the way you conduct yourself, being covered in goo isn't too much.
However, before I could stop her, Aqua charged toward another frog in the distance.
"Ah! Hey, hold up, Aqua!"
Aqua ignored my voice, drawing closer to the frog and using her momentum to throw a punch at its belly.
"Feel the wrath of a goddess! You dare to oppose a goddess!? Repent in hell! God Blow!"
I remembered the staff member in the guild telling me that physical attacks weren't effective against giant frogs.
Her fist sunk into the soft abdomen, while the frog seemed unaffected…
Aqua meekly looked the frog in the eye and said softly:
"… Looking closely… frogs are actually quite cute, right?"
… I defeated a second giant frog that stopped moving as it attempted to swallow its prey. The adventure for today ended with me bringing a wailing goddess covered in slime back to town.

"I get it. Just us two isn't enough, so let's recruit more members!"
After returning to town, the first thing we did was head to the bathhouse to wash up. We then ate fried frog meat in the adventurer's guild and discussed our plans.
Apart from being a meeting place for adventurers, the adventurer's guild also doubled as a bar. It allowed adventurers to sell the monsters they hunted, and serving tasty monsters was also a bit of a selling point for them.
We sold the meat of the two frogs we hunted to the guild and earned some allowance in the process.
The frog was too big for the two of us to carry, but, if you turned in a request to the guild, they'd provide delivery service, transporting the monster you defeated.
Selling one frog and deducting the transport fee earned us 5,000 eris.
The earnings were about the same as doing construction work.
However, the slightly tough fried frog meat was unexpectedly tasty, which surprised me.
When I first came to this world, I was a bit hesitant about eating lizards and frogs.
However, after having one prepared and served to me, I found it to be delicious.
Of course, the goddess before me ate anything without hesitation.
"But… Even if we want to recruit comrades, do you think anyone would want to team up with novices like us who don't even have proper equipment?"
With a mouthful of frog meat, Aqua waved the fork in her hand.
"Wiff mi hare, I juice node…"
"Swallow. Swallow before you speak."
After Aqua swallowed, she said:
"With me here, I just need to holler and people will line up to join us. I'm an Archpriest after all, a top-tier job! I can use all sorts of healing spells and support magic, and I can relieve poison and paralysis statuses. I can even perform resurrection, a talent any team would want. I might've fallen into the mortal world, causing my powers to be far from my peak, but I'm still a goddess… Ahem! I'm Aqua-sama after all! I just need to put up a notice and a bunch of people begging me to 'bring me along on quests' will show up! If you understand, then give me another piece of fried frog meat!"
After finishing, the self-proclaimed goddess grabbed a piece of fried frog meat from my plate as I watched her with worried eyes.

– The next day, at the adventurer's guild.
"… No one's coming…"
Aqua dejectedly mumbled to herself.
After displaying a recruitment notice, we sat at a table inside the adventurer's guild and waited for companions to show up. It had been half a day.
The other adventurers saw our notice.
Besides us, several adventurers were recruiting members; they conducted interviews, talked with them and went off.
I knew very well why no one was coming.
"… Hey, let's lower our standard. Our goal's to defeat the Demon King, so such conditions were necessary… However, 'only recruiting top-tier jobs' is a bit too gruelling."
"Ugh… But…"
In this world, adventurer jobs were divided into tiers, with some of them being top tier jobs.
Aqua's Archpriest was one of those top-tier jobs.
It was difficult for normal people to qualify for this job. She could very well be a hero candidate.
Moreover, it was normal for such hero candidates to enjoy a privileged life in other teams…
Aqua probably wanted to recruit powerful companions to take down the Demon King.
However…
"If this goes on, no one will apply! You might have a top-tier job, but mine's the weakest. I'll lose my place if elites suddenly surround me. How about lowering the entry requirements…?"
As I was preparing to stand up…
"I saw the notice recruiting  adventurers with top-tiers jobs. Are you the ones who posted it?"
She regarded us with red, sleepy eyes.
Her smooth black hair reached her shoulders.
For us, she was a girl in classic witch attire with a black cloak, dark boots, pointy hat and a staff.
Her features were delicate like a porcelain doll–it was a loli.
It wasn't surprising for children to work in this world…
The small, frail girl who looked to be about 12-13 had an eyepatch covering one eye. She flung aside her cloak hard and said:
"My name is Megumin! My calling is that of an Archwizard, and one who controls the strongest offensive magic, Explosion…!"
"…Are you here to tease us?"
"I-I'm not!"
I couldn't help retorting at the self-introduction of this girl as she denied in a panic.
Moreover, what was with the name Megumin?
"That red eye, are you a Crimson Demon?"
The girl nodded in response to Aqua's query and presented her adventurer's card to Aqua.
"That's correct! I'm an elite mage from the Crimson Demon Clan, Megumin! My magic's powerful enough to split the mountains…! … That's how it is. Do you need an excellent mage? … By the way, I've a favour to ask. I haven't eaten in three days; may you give me something to eat before the interview…?"
Megumin looked at us with sorrowful eyes.
The heartbreaking 'ugu' sound came from Megumin's stomach region.
"… I'm fine with treating you to a meal, but why are you wearing an eyepatch? If you're injured, do you need this girl to heal you?"
"Humph… This is a magic item to restrain my overwhelming power… If you pull it off, a gigantic disaster will befall the world…
"Oh… So it's something like a seal?"
"I made that up. This is just a normal eyepatch. It just looks nice… Ah, sorry… Please don't pull on that, stop!"
"Eh… Listen Kazuma, Crimson Demons are born with high intellect and strong magic power, with most of them having the potential to become powerful mages. They're well known for their red eyes and their strange names."
Aqua explained as I pulled on Megumin's eyepatch.
… I understood. Just listening to her name and seeing that eyepatch, I thought she was teasing me.
I released the eyepatch and she said sternly:
"It's rude to say that our names are weird. From where I stand, the names of the people in this town are the weird ones."
"… Right, may I ask for your parents' names?"
"My mother's Yuiyui, and my father's Hyoizaburo."
"…"
Aqua and I were silent.
"… Anyway, this girl's race produces many powerful mages, right? Could we recruit her as a companion?"
"Hey, if you've got a problem with the names of my parents, say it to my face!"
As Megumin leaned forward, Aqua returned the adventurer's card to her.
"It should be fine, right? The adventurer's card is real; she has a  top-tier job with the ability to use powerful spells–Archwizard. The magic stat on the card's very high, so she has a lot of potential. If she really can use explosion magic, that would be amazing! The explosion spell's the highest-tier spell of the detonation-series magic and is hard to learn."
"Hey! Stop addressing me as she, use my name!"
As Megumin protested, I handed the food menu to her.
"Don't mind the details, order something to eat. My name's Kazuma, and this is Aqua. Pleased to meet you, Archwizard."
Megumin seemed like she had something to say, but in the end she just took the menu quietly.

"Explosion's the strongest offensive spell. On the other hand, it has a long casting time. Please keep that frog at bay until I'm ready."
We brought Megumin who'd eaten her fill along to seek revenge against the giant frogs.
I could see a frog at a distance on the plains.
The frog had already noticed us and was charging our way.
In addition, I could see another frog heading toward us from the opposite direction.
"Please target the frog further away. As for the nearer one… Hey, let's go, Aqua. We'll avenge ourselves this time. You're a former goddess, right? How about showing what you're made of?"
"What do you mean by 'former'? I'm a current goddess! My position of an Archpriest's just a disguise!"
Megumin looked at the self-proclaimed goddess choking me and said:
"… Goddess?"
"… Just a pitiful woman claiming to be a goddess. She'll say stuff like this from time to time, so please don't mind her."
After hearing my explanation, Megumin looked at Aqua with sympathetic eyes.
Aqua was on the verge of tears and charged toward the nearer frog in frustration with her fist clenched.
"You're just frogs that are strong against physical attacks! Let me show you the power of a goddess! Kazuma, watch this carefully! I haven't done anything great yet, but I'll definitely succeed today!"
Aqua, who lacked the capacity to learn, shouted and succeeded in infiltrating the body of the frog, stopping its movements.
As expected of a goddess, sacrificing herself to buy us time.
… Then, the air around Megumin started to tremble.
Even a novice to magic like me could tell that Megumin was preparing to use some remarkable magic.
Megumin's chanting grew louder as sweat fell from her temples.
"Watch closely; this is the strongest attack spell known to humans… The ultimate attack spell."
The tip of Megumin's staff started to glow.
The scale might've been small, but it seemed to accumulate a vast amount of light as it shone brightly.
Megumin's red eye shone with a brilliant light.
"Explosion!"
A light flashed through the plains.
The light emitted from the tip of Megumin's staff shot forward, hitting the frog approaching us dead on…!
The violent effect of the spell was seen immediately.
A dazzling light filled my vision as the frog was blown to pieces with a reverberating bang.
Almost blown away by the strong wind, I covered my face and braced myself.
After the dust settled, a crater twenty meters in diameter revealed where the frog had been, showing how powerful the explosion was.
"… Amazing–so this is magic."
As I was feeling moved by the power of Megumin's spell,another frog slowly climbed out from underground, probably awakened by the shockwave and sound of the explosion.
I was thinking that without rain and a water source in the plains, the frogs would dry up under the hot sun. It turned out that they burrowed underground to avoid baking alive.
The frog climbing out was near Megumin, but its movements were very slow.
If we used this chance to move away from the frog and let Megumin use her explosion spell again, we could blow the frog into cinders.
"Megumin! Let's retreat for now and attack from a distance…!"
I looked over at Megumin.
My body turned stiff…
Because Megumin was lying face down on the ground.
"Humph… Explosion's my ultimate spell. It's powerful and uses a lot of mana. Simply put, the mana I used exceeded my limit, so I can't move. Ah, to think that a frog would appear out of nowhere… No good, I'll be eaten. Sorry, please save me. Hya…!"
With their movements sealed by the body of Aqua and Megumin, I finished off the two frogs.
We completed the mission to defeat five giant frogs in three days.

"Ugh… Ugh… Sniff… It smells… It smells like fish…"
Aqua snivelled as she followed behind me, covered in slime.
"It's smelly inside the frog, but the warm feeling isn't too bad… I gained some knowledge that I'd rather not know…"
Megumin, covered in goo like Aqua and being carried on my back, told me something I never wanted to learn.
If someone used magic that exceeded his or her mana capacity, it'd drain his or her life force to make up for the difference.
Using powerful spells with your mana depleted might even lead to death.
"From now on, explosion magic's banned unless there's an emergency. Please get by with your other spells from now on, Megumin."
After hearing what I said, Megumin grabbed my shoulders harder.
"… I can't."
"… Huh? You can't what?"
I parroted Megumin's words.
Megumin grabbed even harder and pressed her lacking chest onto my back.
"… I can only use Explosion; I don't know any other magic."
"… Are you serious?"
"… Yes."
As Megumin and I turned silent, Aqua, who was snivelling, joined in our discussion.
"What do you mean you only know Explosion? If you had enough skill points to learn Explosion, you must've learned other spells, right?"
… Skill points?
Speaking of which, the counter lady at the guild did mention something about skill points.
Seeing that I was confused, Aqua explained to me:
"Skill points are something you earn when you choose a job; it's used to learn skills. The more potential a person has, the more skill points they start out with. You can learn all sorts of skills by investing skill points in them. For example, the excellent me has learned all the banquet party tricks as well as all the spells of an Archpriest."
"… Where are you going to use banquet party tricks?"
Aqua pretended not to hear my question and continued:
"Depending on the person and the job, there are restrictions to the skills they may learn. For example, someone with a fear of water would need more points to learn water or ice elemental spells… However, as detonation-series magic consists of composite spells, you'd need deep knowledge of fire and wind magic to master it. This means that people who can learn detonation magic should be able to easily learn other spells."
"This means that it doesn't make sense to be unable to learn low-tier spells when you know high-tier magic from the detonation-series… Anyway, where can you make use of banquet party tricks?"
Megumin mumbled when I finished my sentence:
"… I'm an Archwizard that loves Explosion. What I like is not detonation-series magic, but Explosion."
Really, what was the difference between detonation spells and Explosion? I didn't get it at all.
Aqua listened to Megumin's monologue with a serious face.
No, compared to that, I was very distracted by the banquet party tricks.
"Adventures will definitely be easier if I learn other spells. Fire, water, earth, wind and light… Learning spells related to this should be good enough… However, I couldn't do it; my only love is Explosion. Even though I can only cast it once per day, even if I'll collapse after using the spell, my one true love is still Explosion! The only reason I chose the path of the Archwizard was to cast explosion spells."
"Incredible! Great! Your resolve to follow your romantic dreams despite knowing it's inefficient really moved me!"
… Oh no, it seemed like this mage was going to be useless.
The best evidence was her hitting it off with Aqua.
After two battles with the frogs, I highly doubted the usefulness of this goddess.
Honestly, just Aqua alone was troublesome enough. If another one were to join in…
All right, I made up my mind.
"I see. I think this will be a difficult path, so do work hard. Ah, I can see the town. Let's divide the rewards equally at the guild. Yes, let's meet again if our paths cross once more."
Megumin grabbed me harder after I finished.
"Humph… My only wish is to use explosion magic; the bounty's just a complementary bonus. How about this: I don't need an even share of the rewards. If you're willing to foot the bill for food, bath and miscellaneous items, I can consider not taking any rewards. That's right, my power as an Archwizard is available at the price of meals and other miscellaneous fees! How could you miss this opportunity to form a long-term contract?"
"No, no, no, our weak team isn't worthy of such amazing power. That's right, it's too much to ask Megumin to stay in our team with your amazing powers. A team just starting out should make do with a normal mage. Look at me, my job's even the weakest one, Adventurer."
To chase away Megumin, who was grabbing on to me tightly when we reached the guild, I attempted to loosen her grip.
Nevertheless, Megumin refused to let go.
"No, no, no, it doesn't matter if you're novices or weak. I might have a top-tier job, but I'm still a beginner too. My level's just six. When my level grows, I won't collapse after using my spells. So let's talk this over, and then you may pull my hand away, okay?"
"No, no, no, it's too hard to utilize a mage that can only cast one spell a day. Ugh, she's a mage but her grip's strong…! Let go, the other teams probably didn't want you either. Or rather, one can't use explosion spells in dungeons or indoors, which would render you useless. Hey, release your grip! I'll split the rewards equally with you, so please let go!"
"Please don't ditch me! No team's willing to take me! I'm willing to carry the luggage or anything when exploring dungeons, so please don't throw me away!"
It was probably because Megumin on my back was yelling, 'Don't throw me away', that the passersby started whispering while looking at us.
Because we were in town and Aqua's appearance drew a lot of attention, it made us the center of focus.
"– No way, that man wants to abandon that child…"
"– He has a girl covered in slime with him."
"– To toy with such a small child and to abandon her after that, what trash. Look, why is there goo covering the girls? What weird sexual games did that pervert make them do?"
… The passersby maligned me.
Aqua smiled deviously upon hearing them, how hateful.
Megumin seemed to have heard their whispers too.
I looked at Megumin who was peeking over my shoulder, only to see a malicious smile showing on her face…
"I'm fine with any sort of play! Even using the frog's slime just like now is okay…"
"All right–I get it! Megumin, I'll be in your care!"

"All right, everything's in order. I've confirmed that your team has finished the quest of defeating 5 giant frogs in 3 days. Good work."
After reporting in at the guild's counter, I received the promised reward.
Since Aqua and Megumin were covered in slime, they'd be too smelly if they didn't wash up. It might cause misunderstandings for me, so I shooed them off to the bath house.
One of the frogs we defeated disintegrated because of the explosion magic, so I was afraid it might've affected the completion of the quest. But the type and number of monsters defeated were recorded on the adventurer's card, so there were no problems.
I handed in my and Megumin's card to the counter lady, which she put in a strange box-like machine. The confirmation was done just like that.
Things developed in this world used magic instead of science, so the technological level of this world was quite advanced.
I looked at my card again and saw that I was at level 4.
I heard that those frogs were great for novice adventurers to grind levels.
I defeated 4 frogs by myself, enough to raise my level to 4.
It was easier for low-leveled people to level up.
All the stats on the card increased slightly, but I didn't feel myself getting any stronger.
"… But, I can really get stronger just by killing monsters…"
I mumbled to myself.
The counter lady did mention that when she explained it in the beginning.
All things in this world have souls. No matter what form it takes, if you eat or kill a being, you can absorb a part of the memory of the soul. That was what she said.
This part felt like a computer game.
Looking at it closely, there was something called 'Skill Points' on it, which showed the number 3.
Just by spending these points, I could learn skills.
"Well then, turning in 2 giant frogs, in addition to receiving the bounty for completing the quest, comes to a total of 110,000 eris. Please take this."
110,000.
These giant frogs yielded 5,000 eris after deducting transport fees.
So the bounty for the 5 frogs was 100,000 eris.
Aqua said that quests were completed with a team of 4 to 6 adventurers.
So for normal adventurers, risking your life to fight 5 frogs for a couple of days would yield about 125,000 eris. For a 5-man team, that would be 25,000 eris each.
… It wasn't worth it.
Finishing the mission in one day meant a daily salary of 25,000.
It might've seemed like a good deal for a daily salary, but considering the risk involved, it didn't seem to be worth the effort.
If another frog had shown up and eaten me, the three of us would've been wiped out.
That sent a chill down my spine.
I looked at the other quests. The ones on the bulletin board were–
– Cut down the evil trees corrupting the forest, bounty's dependent on the amount turned in.
– Help me look for my pet white wolf.
– My son's swordsmanship lesson *Requirement: Rune Knight or Sword Master.
– Recruiting subject for magic practice * Requirement: High HP or strong magic resistance…
Yeah.
It wasn't easy to survive in this world.
I felt like returning to Japan on my second day of adventuring.
"… Excuse me, may I ask…?"
Just when I was getting a little homesick as I sat down on a chair nearby, someone spoke to me from behind.
Feeling tired of dealing with the realities of this different world, I turned my head with hollow eyes.
"Is something the matter…?"
I was speechless when I saw the person talking to me.
She was a female knight.
She was a super beautiful female knight.
She gave off the vibe of a cool beauty at first sight as she looked at me expressionlessly.
She was a bit taller than I was.
My height was 165 cm (5 ft. 5 in).
A bit taller than me should be about 170 cm (5 ft. 7 in).
She was wearing solid metal armor all over her body, a beauty with blonde hair and blue eyes.
Probably a year or two older than me.
I couldn't tell her body shape from her armor, but I felt that she was very curvy.
Her face seemed rather cold… How should I put this, it picked on your masochistic side…?
… Ah. This wasn't good, I was entranced.
"Ah, eh–what's the matter?"
Facing Aqua, who was about my age, and Megumin, who was younger than me, was fine, but this beauty slightly older than me made me stutter.
That was the bad point about living the life of a hikikomori for an extended period.
"Um… The team that put up this recruitment notice was you, right? Are you still looking for people?"
The female knight showed me a piece of paper.
Indeed, we didn't tear away that notice after Megumin joined our party.
"Oh–we're still hiring. Although I wouldn't recommend you joining…"
"Please pick me! Please let me join your party!"
When I was about to reject her tactfully, the female knight suddenly grabbed my hand.
… Eh?
"No, no, no, hold up. Our party has plenty of problems; the other two members are burdens and my job's the weakest. Because of that, my two companions were covered in slime… Ow! Ow! Ow!"
When I mentioned the slime, the female knight tightened her grip on my hand.
"I was right, those two covered in goo were your comrades! What happened, how'd they end up like that…!? I-I also…! Want to experience that…!"
"Huh?"
What'd she just say?
"No, I phrased it wrongly. For the two young girls to experience that at such a tender age… as a knight, I can't stand by and watch. My job's the top-tier Crusader, so it should fit your recruitment criteria."
What was with this female knight? Her eyes looked dangerous. I thought she was a calm and collected big sister!
But my danger radar was acting up.
She gave off the same feeling as Aqua and Megumin.
… She might've been a beauty, but it couldn't be helped.
"Ara–I didn't finish. I really don't recommend you joining. One of our party members is useless, the other can only cast one spell a day and I have the weakest job. That's the lame party this is, so I suggest you find another…?"
The female knight strengthened her grip further.
"That's perfect! To be honest, I'm confident in my strength and durability, but I'm not too agile with my hands… So I can't hit the enemy…"
My sensor was right.
"So you don't need to treat me as having a top-tier job; I'll just charge ahead without a care, so abuse me like a shield."
The female knight shoved her pretty face in front of me.
Her face was too close!
Because I was sitting, she was looking at me from up high. The female knight's golden locks brushed against my face, making my heart race.
My time as a hikikomori was affecting me again…!
No, this was simply too stimulating for an adolescent virgin boy, making me uneasy.
Calm down, don't get seduced by her charm!
"No, how can I let a girl act like a shield? My party's super weak, so the attacks will really hit you. The monsters might gang up on you in every fight!"
"That's the way I like it!"
"No, how should I put this…? My two companions were eaten by frogs and covered in slime! This might happen every day!"
"That's exactly what I want!"
… Oh, I get it.
The blushing female knight who was holding my hand.
Looking at her, I understood something.
… This girl wasn't just useless, her character was rotten to the core.

"Hey, there's something I want to ask the both of you. How do you learn skills?"
The day after fighting the frogs.
We were having a late lunch at the guild's bar.
Before me was the penniless Megumin, who hadn't had a proper meal before meeting us and was focusing on eating her lunch, and Aqua, calling for the waitress to order more food.
Their appetites were too great for ladies of their tender age.
… Two women and a single man was still a harem party, but it totally didn't feel that way at all…
Megumin raised her head while holding her fork and said:
"Learning skills? That's easy, look at your card and choose one from the 'Learnable skills' column… Oh right, Kazuma's job's Adventurer. In that case, you need someone to teach you a skill. You need to see the skill in action and ask the user to teach you how to use it. It'll then show up in the learnable column, then you can spend skill points to learn the skill."
I see.
I remembered the counter lady saying that the basic-tier job, Adventurer, could learn any skill.
If that was the case…
"… That means if Megumin teaches me, I could use explosion magic?"
"Yeah, exactly!"
"Whoa!"
Megumin reacted strongly to my casual words.
"That's right, Kazuma! The skill points needed would be absurdly high, but Adventurer is the only job other than Archwizard that can use Explosion. I can teach you if you want to learn. Or rather, there are no other skills that are worth learning except Explosion, right? Of course not! Come, let's walk the path of Explosion together!"
Her face was too close!
"Wait, calm down loli! I only have 3 skill points, there's no way I can learn it, right?"
"L-Loli…?"
Megumin was too excited to hold a proper conversation, so I asked Aqua instead.
"If an adventurer wants to learn the explosion spell, 20 or so skill points won't be enough. You'll probably need to train for a decade or two and invest all your points to learn it."
"Who has that kind of patience?"
"Fu… To call me a loli…"
Megumin seemed stunned by me addressing her as a loli, dejectedly eating her set meal in small bites.
But the only good point about my job–Adventurer–was the ability to learn any skill. Of course I wanted to learn more skills.
"Hey Aqua, you should have many convenient skills, right? Do you have any easy-to-learn skills to teach me? I prefer those that don't need a lot of points and are very useful."
Aqua thought for a moment while holding her cup of water.
"… It can't be helped–but I have to warn you, my skills are amazing! They're not meant to be passed on lightly!"
I wasn't happy about Aqua mouthing off like that, but I had to bear with it since I was asking her to teach me.
I obediently nodded my head and watched Aqua's every movement.
"Well, look at this cup. Put this cupful of water on top of your head and don't let it fall off. Here, try it."
It was a bit embarrassing to do that in public, but I mimicked Aqua's action and put the cup on top of my head.
Aqua then took out an unknown seed and placed it on the table.
"All right. Now use your finger to flick the seed into the cup; you must do it in one try. Something amazing is happening! The seed's absorbing the water and sprouting…"
"Who asked you to teach me party tricks, you worthless goddess!?"
"Eh–?"
Aqua became as dejected as Megumin for some reason and rolled the seed around the table with her finger.
I don't know what's getting you so down, but can you remove the cup from your head? It's drawing a lot of attention.
"Ha! That's hilarious! Hey, you're the party Darkness wanted to join, right? You want to learn something useful? How about Thief skills?"
Someone suddenly interjected.
I turned my head and saw two women occupying the neighbouring table.
The one talking to me was a woman wearing light, leather armour.
She had a small scar on her face and seemed to be street smart. She was a pretty girl with silver locks and a bright personality.
Beside her was a blond beauty in full plate mail.
The unapproachable cool beauty…
Indeed, it was the female knight that wanted to join our party yesterday.
The thief-girl looked to be about a year or two younger than I was.
"Um, what do you mean by Thief skills? How are they like?"
The thief-girl responded cheerfully:
"Good question. Thief skills are very practical–such as Disarm Traps, Enemy Detection, Lurk and Steal. They're all skills that are worth learning. Your job's the basic-tier Adventurer, right? Thief skills don't require many points, so it's a great offer! How about it? I'll teach them to you for the price of a glass of crimson beer!"
So cheap!
That was how I felt. But when I thought about it, she had nothing to lose from teaching me these skills.
And I could just ask any other Thief if I really wanted to learn Thief skills.
"Okay, I'll leave it in your hands! Excuse me, a glass of ice-cold crimson beer for this lady please!"

"Right, let me properly introduce myself. I'm Chris. As you can see, I'm a Thief. And this person with a moody face is Darkness. You met yesterday, right? She's a Crusader and shouldn't have any skills that are useful to you."
"Hello! I'm Kazuma. Nice to meet you, Chris!"
In the open plaza behind the adventurer's guild.
Chris, Darkness and I stood at this desolate and open space.
By the way, those two companions of mine remained sulking at the table while we were talking, so I left them there.
"Well then, we'll start with Enemy Detection and Lurk. We'll work on Disarm Traps next time, since traps are rare in such a crowded place. Hey Darkness, could you turn over there for a moment?"
"… Hmm? … Okay."
Darkness turned away as instructed.
And so, Chris got into a wooden barrel some distance away and showed only the top half of her body.
I didn't know what she was playing at, but she then threw a rock at Darkness's head and hid into the barrel.
"……"
Could this be the Lurk skill?
Darkness, who was hit by the rock, moved silently toward the only barrel in the area.
"Sensing enemy… Sensing enemy… I can strongly feel Darkness's anger! Hey, Darkness? You know I only did that to teach him the skills, I couldn't help it! Please have mercy… Ahhh, stop! Ahhh!"
The barrel she was hidden in toppled over and Chris screamed as it rolled on the ground.
… Could I really learn new skills this way…?
"All right. Let's try the skill I recommend the most, Steal. This is a skill that can snatch away one item possessed by the target. It can be anything, be it the weapon gripped tightly in their hands or the wallet secured deep in their pockets.The probability of success is dependent on the luck stat. You can take the weapon or treasure of a strong enemy and run, so it's a great skill to have under any circumstances."
After Chris recovered from the dizziness of being rolled around in a barrel, she explained Steal to me.
It sounded very useful indeed.
And it was dependent on the luck stat, which means my only high stat would finally be put to use.
"I'll demonstrate with you as the target! Ready, Steal!"
Chris shouted as she reached her hand forward and a small item appeared in her hand.
That was…
"Ah! That's my wallet!"
It contained all my cash, a thin and pitiful wallet.
"Oh! Jackpot! It's used this way. Well of course, I'll give the wallet back…"
Chris smiled deviously as she was about to return the wallet to me.
"… Hey… Let's have a match, all right? Try learning Steal now. I'll then let you steal one item from me. I won't complain even if you steal my wallet or weapon. Your wallet's so thin that my weapon or wallet will be more valuable. That means we'll be trading in whatever items that are stolen… How about it? Want to try?"
This person suddenly said something amazing.
I thought about it.
My luck seemed ridiculously high…
I could steal one item from the opponent…
So I'd be getting something even if the skill failed.
… Let's give it a go.
Such gambles seemed like the way rash adventurers would interact; just what I was looking forward to!
Indeed, I was finally experiencing something adventurer-like after coming to this world!
I looked at my adventurer's card and saw a new box with learnable skills displayed on it.
I touched it with my finger and 4 skills appeared.
Enemy Detection – 1 point, Lurk- 1 point, Steal – 1 point, Nature's Beauty – 5 points.
… Nature's Beauty? The skill used by Aqua, the party trick of flicking a seed into a cup?
That party trick had such a flashy name! Eh? And it's expensive!
Party tricks were cool in their own way, but I decided to learn Steal, Enemy Detection and Lurk.
I used up all my skill points.
I see, so that's how you learn skills.
"I've learned the skill and I accept your challenge! Don't come crying to me no matter what I steal!"
I stuck out my right hand as I spoke, but Chris just smiled fearlessly.
"That's great! I like people who aren't spoilsports! All right then, what can you steal? The special prize will be my wallet! The grand prize will be this enchanted dagger! This is a great item worth 400,000 eris! The consolation prize will be this piece of rock I threw at Darkness!"
"Ah! Using such a method is cheating!"
I protested loudly when I saw the rock Chris took out.
I was wondering why she was so confident; so that was the reason!
If she had more trash items, the probability of important items getting stolen would be lower, a sort of safeguard against thieves.
"This is my teaching fee. As you can see, no skills are all powerful. You learned something great, right? All right, give it a go!"
Damn, I was really schooled!
Looking at Chris laughing out loud, I felt foolish for falling for this trick.
This wasn't Japan, but a dog-eat-dog world.
It was the fault of those who were naive enough to be tricked.
It was only a chance of failure, though; it wasn't a total loss..
"All right, watch this! My luck has always been good! Steal!"
As I shouted, my outstretched right hand grabbed something.
She said the chance of success was dependent on the luck stat. To succeed in one try, my luck wasn't too bad.
I opened my hand and looked at what I stole…
"… What's this?"
It was a piece of white cloth.
I took the cloth with both hands and raised it to the sun for a better look…
"Yahoo–! It's the grand prize, and it's a big one–!"
"No–! Give me back my panties–!"
Chris pulled down her skirt as she screamed with tears in her eyes.

After learning the skills, I returned to the bar and found it to be lively.
"Aqua-sama, one more time! I'm willing to pay for it, so could you perform Nature's Beauty once more?"
"Fool, Aqua-san prefers food instead of money! Right, Aqua-san? I'll treat you to a meal, so please do Nature's Beauty again!"
For some reason, there was a crowd around a troubled-looking Aqua.
"My performances aren't things that can be performed whenever they're requested! A great man once said that 'a funny joke can only be told once'. Doing the same tricks repeatedly because they're popular means you're a third-rate performer! And I'm not a performer, so I won't accept money for my performance! This should be the basic attitude of a performance artisan. And I didn't perform Nature's Beauty for you to see– Ah! Kazuma, you're finally back. It turned out like this because of you… By the way, what's with her?"
Aqua pushed through the crowd with an annoyed face and was curious about the sulky Chris standing beside me.
Before I could explain, Darkness said:
"Chris's panties were removed by Kazuma, and then she lost all her money to him. That's why she's feeling down."
"Hey, what's this nonsense!? Hold up. Well, you're not wrong, but hold on a minute."
Because Chris was willing to pay any amount of money as she begged me to return her panties, I told her to decide how much her panties were worth.
I added that if Chris didn't offer an amount that'd satisfy me, her panties would become my family heirloom.
In the end, she offered both her wallet and my wallet. So I agreed to the trade, that was all. But Darkness's way of phrasing it sounded a bit wrong.
Aqua and Megumin were a bit surprised after hearing what Darkness said. Their gazes made me feel uncomfortable and Chris shook off her sulky expression at this moment and said:
"Even if I was stripped of my panties in public, I can't keep on crying! All right, Darkness. I'm sorry, but I've decided to join a profitable dungeon exploration party! I'm penniless after my panties were taken hostage."
"Hey, wait a second. The female adventurers aside from Aqua and Megumin are starting to give me cold looks, so please don't speak anymore."
The female adventurers nearby seemed to have heard the conversation.
Seeing how awkward I looked in their cold gaze, Chris laughed happily.
"This is acceptable as payback, right? Well then, I'll be back after earning some cash, so have fun in the meantime, Darkness! I'll find what quests are available!"
Chris ran to the bulletin board recruiting for members after saying that.
"Um. Aren't you going with her, Darkness?"
Darkness sat down at my table so naturally that I had to ask.
"… No. Thieves are essential for dungeon exploration, so there are many teams that'd want to recruit Chris. On the other hand, vanguards like me can be found anywhere."
I see. Aqua did say that Archpriests were rare and wanted by every party; so the treatment each job received was different, huh.
A short while later, Chris found a pick-up group and left the guild with a few adventurers.
She waved at us before heading off.
"It's already evening, are they going to explore the dungeons now?"
"The best time to go dungeon diving is early in the morning, so most people would set off one day earlier like them and make camp before the dungeon. There are even merchants operating with these adventurers as their target market. So how was it? Did you learn any skills?"
Hearing Megumin say that, I smiled confidently.
"Humph, why not see for yourself? Here I go, Steal!"
I shouted and reached toward Megumin with my right hand, grabbing a black cloth tightly.
Indeed, they were panties.
"… What happened? After your level and stats increased, did you change jobs from an Adventurer to a pervert? Um… It's a little drafty, so please give me my panties back…"
"Strange? It shouldn't be like this… It should be a skill that steals something at random!"
I hurriedly returned the panties to Megumin under the increasingly cold glare of the females around me. Someone suddenly slammed the table.
It was Darkness, who had knocked her chair away and stood up.
Her eyes were sparkling for some reason…
"I was right! To strip the panties of a young girl with so many people watching, you really are the worst…! Please…! Please let me join this party!"
"No."
"Hmm…? Eh…!"
Darkness's face turned red and her body trembled when she heard my immediate reply.
What should I do? I wasn't very sure, but this female knight was certainly of the bad sort.
Aqua and Megumin seemed curious about Darkness…
"Hey, who's this person, Kazuma? Was she the one who came for the interview while Megumin and I were in the bath?"
"Hold on, this lady's a Crusader. There's no reason to reject her, right?"
The two of them started talking nonsense as they stared at Darkness.
This was bad… And I remembered rejecting her yesterday too.
I didn't want these two to meet Darkness…
… All right, I'll have to use this method.
"Darkness, we might look this way now, but we're serious about taking down the Demon King."
Aqua who wanted to return to heaven aside, I'd already given up on that after finding out how harsh this world was. Even killing a toad was a chore.
Megumin, who had never heard of this before, looked surprised, but I ignored her.
No, wait. This might be a good opportunity.
"That's right, you listen too, Megumin. Aqua and I want to take down the Demon King no matter what. That's our goal as adventurers. And so our adventures will only become more dangerous, especially for Darkness. As a female knight, you might experience 'that' if you get captured by the Demon King."
"That's right! Since ancient times, getting sexually harassed by the Demon King was the job of the female knights! That alone would be worth the trip!"
"Eh…!? What!?"
"Huh…? What is it? Did I say something weird?"
Darkness, who expressed her strong agreement, made me shout in surprise.
… A-Anyway, I'll settle that later.
"Listen carefully too, Megumin. The opponent's the Demon King. Aqua and I are planning to fight the strongest being in this world, so don't force yourself by staying in this party…"
I didn't even finish.
Megumin knocked her chair away and stood up.
She flicked her cloak hard and said:
"I'm Megumin! The top mage of the Crimson Demons, the master of explosion magic! For the Demon King to overlook me and call himself the strongest, I'll decimate him with my strongest spell!"
With the entire guild's eyes on her, Megumin made a chunni declaration.
This fellow was hopeless too. Don't make such an arrogant face so confidently!
Oh no, these two hopeless girls raised the tension even higher…
"… Hey Kazuma, Kazuma…"
As I dropped my head dejectedly, Aqua pulled at my sleeve.
"I was a bit scared when Kazuma put it that way. Is there a simpler way to take on the Demon King?"
… You should be the one most fired up since this is your quest…
… At that moment.
"Emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers in town, please gather at the adventurer's guild! I repeat, emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers in town, please gather at the adventurer's guild!"
The loud broadcast could be heard throughout the entire town.
It was probably amplified through magic.
"Hey, what are 'emergency quests'? Are monsters raiding the town?"
I felt a bit uneasy, but Darkness and Megumin seemed elated. Darkness said joyfully:
"… Um, it's probably cabbage harvesting. It's the season for them."
……
"Huh? Cabbages? Is that the name of some monster?"
After expressing my thoughts, Megumin and Darkness looked at me pitifully for unknown reasons.
"A cabbage is something round, green and edible."
"It's crunchy and refreshing, a delicious vegetable."
"I know that! Then what's happening? The guild said there was an emergency quest. So do the farmers need help from the adventurers?"
It seemed weird for me who was working as a construction worker recently to say this, but I didn't come here to farm.
"Ah, Kazuma probably doesn't know. Let me tell you, the cabbages of this world…"
Aqua adopted an apologetic pose and was about to tell me something when the guild staff interrupted her as she addressed the adventurers in the building.
"I apologize for gathering everyone on such a short notice! I'm sure everyone knows that the emergency is because of the cabbages! It's time to harvest cabbages! The quality's great this year and each one's worth 10,000 eris! We've already evacuated the residents so please harvest more cabbages and turn them in here! Please take care of your own safety and don't get hurt from the cabbages' counterattack! Also, because of the large amount of people and bounty, the reward will be given out later!"
… What'd this staff member say?
The sound of cheers erupted outside the adventurer's guild.
I didn't know what'd happened, so I squeezed into the crowd outside to look. Green objects were flying all over town.
As I stood on the spot amazed by the ridiculous sight, Aqua came over to my side and continued her explanation:
"The cabbages in this world can fly. When their taste ripens during harvest season, they fly through cities, over plains, across the continent and to the ocean, unwilling to be eaten. Because of that, we need to catch the cabbages and eat them while they're still delicious."
"May I go back to the stables and sleep?"
As I mumbled softly, the brave adventurers charged out in high spirits.
They were hot-blooded guys who were inspired by the cabbages that did their best to live for the moment.
As I watched the adventurers chase after the cabbages wholeheartedly, I prayed.
… What grave sin did I commit to fight to the death with cabbages here?
… I want to go back to Japan.

I took a bite of the fried cabbages sold here.
"Why does a mere cabbage taste so good? I don't get it."
The cabbage hunt quest ended and the entire town began serving dishes made from cabbages.
It was very profitable, so I ended up joining the cabbage hunt quest, but I still regretted it a little.
I didn't come to this world to fight cabbages.
"You're skilled, Darkness! As expected of a Crusader! The cabbages couldn't break through your iron-wall defense no matter what they did."
"No, I didn't do much, I'm just really tough. I'm clumsy and slow so I can't really hit my target; my only strong point is shielding others… Megumin has an impressive offence. You took out the horde of monsters that were chasing the cabbages right into town with just one explosion attack; all the other adventurers were shocked."
"Kuku, no one could stand up to the power of my explosion magic… But Kazuma was the most active one, he picked me up after I exhausted my mana and carried me back."
"… Yeah, when I was surrounded by cabbages and monsters, Kazuma showed up and captured all the cabbages attacking me. Thank you for rescuing me."
"Indeed, erasing your presence with Lurk, grasping the movement of the cabbages with Enemy Detection and surprising them with Steal from behind. That was just like an outstanding assassin."
Aqua finally finished her cabbages and casually placed her plate on the table.
The useless goddess who chased the cabbages without a plan and didn't perform too well wiped her mouth gracefully and said:
"Kazuma, with my authority, I grant you the title of 'Elegant Cabbage Thief'."
"Shut up! I'll slap you if you call me that! Ah! Enough, why'd things turn out this way!?"
I hugged my head and rested it on the table.
This was bad.
"Well then. I'm Darkness, a Crusader. Theoretically, my weapon's a two-handed sword, but don't count on it too much. I'm clumsy with my hands and tend to miss. But I'm good at being a tank, so please take care of me."
We officially received another companion.
Aqua smiled leisurely, looking pleased.
"… Humph, our party's becoming great. I'm an Archpriest, Megumin's an Archwizard, and now we have the defensive specialist vanguard, the Crusader Darkness. Three out of four members having top-tier jobs is rare, Kazuma! Do you know how lucky you are? You have to be grateful, okay?"
A mage that could only use one spell a day, a vanguard that couldn't hit anyone… And a cleric that was dumb, had bad luck and was totally useless!
During the cabbage hunt quest, Darkness, Aqua and Megumin hit it off, so they wanted Darkness to join the team too.
If she was normal, I would've had no reason to reject.
And she was also a beauty.
But Darkness couldn't hit her targets at all.
Although she was a looker…
She put all her skill points into defensive skills, so normal skills learned by vanguards such as Two-handed Sword or skills that raised her proficiency with weapons were ignored.
She looked really beautiful too, so it really was a pity.
And this Crusader loved to charge into the midst of monsters for some reason.
As a Crusader who defended the weak, having a stronger calling than others to protect others was a good thing…
"Ugh… Ah, the feeling of being ravaged by cabbages and monsters is unbearable… I'm the only orthodox vanguard in this party, so don't hold back. Use me as bait or as a shield. If it's necessary, you can even cut me off as a sacrifice… Hmm! Just… Just imagining that made me tremble in excitement…!"
Darkness's face was blushing as she shivered slightly.
… So that was how this fellow was.
A super masochist.
She looked like a cool beauty, but she was just a pervert in my eyes.
"Well then, Kazuma. I'll probably… No. I'll certainly be a bother to you, so don't hold back and lecture me viciously. Please take care of me from now on."
An Archpriest that could use all sorts of healing spells and an Archwizard that could use the strongest spell.
And a Crusader with an iron wall-like defense.
It seemed to be a perfect formation, but I felt things would be tough on me in the future.

My level was now 6.
This meant that I rose two levels during the cabbage hunt.
I only captured them but didn't defeat them, so why'd my level rise?
And why do the cabbages yield so many experience points?
There were way too many things to complain about, but it'd be a pain to go through all of them, so I let it be.
You lost if you got too hung up with the peculiarities of this world.
One head of cabbage was worth 10,000 eris. The bounty was so high because eating fresh cabbage granted you experience points.
This meant rich adventurers could get stronger just by eating vegetables.
With the rise in level, my skill points also increased.
As for why such an RPG-like phenomenon happened with the increase in level, I decided to ignore it. Thinking too much about it will make me lose sleep.
I had to say it again, you lost if you took issue with such things.
I had 2 skill points.
I looked for the mage and swordsman from another party I met during the cabbage hunt and asked them to teach me the One-handed Sword and Basic Magic skills.
Each skill costed a point.
The One-handed Sword skill raised proficiency with one-handed swords.
My swordsmanship was now on par with normal people.
Although I used up my points, I'd always wanted to learn swordsmanship and, of course, magic.
Anyone would've wanted to learn magic after coming to a world of magic.
With basic spells, I could use elemental magic like fire, water, earth and wind, although they were simple spells.
By the way, Basic Magic didn't have offensive spells, so most mages would skip them and save their skill points for Intermediate Magic.
But it'd take 10 points to learn Intermediate Magic .
Since it'd take that many points, I should give up learning offensive magic. My magic stat was low anyway.
Some talented people were naturally born with skill points.
It wasn't strange for such talented people who could choose top-tier jobs right off the bat to start with dozens of skill points.
Aqua aside, Megumin and Darkness were probably privileged from the very start.
But in contrast, I had 0 skill points at level 1.
… I'll get more depressed if I think about it too much, so I should stop.
After learning skills, I looked more like an adventurer.
What was left was getting some proper gear.
I'd sometimes wear clothes purchased in this world, but my current equipment was just the gym clothes I started out with and a short sword.
I wanted some armour even if it was just leather.
And so…
"… Why do I have to tag along and shop with you?"
I brought the complaining Aqua along to the armour shop.
"No, you should prepare some equipment too. I might only have my gym clothes, but you're in the same boat, right? Your only equipment's that flimsy hagoromo, right?"
Aqua was dressed the same way as she was when she first came to this world with me.
The light-purple, translucent hagoromo complemented Aqua's blue hair and eyes. It was the only equipment she wore over her clothes.
After changing into her pajamas, she'd use a bucket of water to wash her hagoromo. I'd seen her sunning the hagoromo along with the hay that was drying in the sun.
Aqua said in surprise:
"Don't be stupid–I think you've forgotten that I'm a goddess! This hagoromo's a holy relic. It can defend against abnormal statuses and has great durability. It's a heavily enchanted precious artifact! There's no other equipment better than this!"
I felt like telling her not to dry it along with the hay.
"That's great news. If we really can't make ends meet, then we can just pawn off your holy relic… Oh. This chest armour looks neat, although it's made of leather."
"… Ka-Kazuma, you're joking, right? This hagoromo's proof of my divinity! Y-You won't really sell it, right? No! I-I won't allow it!"

"… Oh, I almost couldn't recognize you."
"Whoa–Kazuma finally looks the part of an adventurer."
As we met up in the adventurer's guild, Darkness and Megumin commented on my attire.
If I didn't look like an adventurer before, did I look like a suspicious person…? I felt like finding out.
Right now I was wearing the attire of this world, with leather chest armour and metallic gauntlets and shin guards.
Aqua complained that my gym clothes clashed with the fantasy feel of this world, so I bought some new ones a couple of days ago.
I was told that it'd be more convenient to leave one hand free to use magic skills.
Even though it was just basic spells, I still learned magic. So I decided to forgo the shield and use a single-edge sword in the style of a magic swordsman.
I used half of the money I won in the bet against Chris, and the remaining money would be enough for me to get by for another week or two.
Now that I'm properly prepared with skills and equipment, I felt like taking on a quest.
I told everyone my thoughts and Darkness nodded in agreement.
"It's the giant toad mating season, and they've been showing up near town. How about…"
"No toads!"
Darkness was rejected by Aqua and Megumin.
"… Why not? Toads fear blades and are easy to take down, their sole mode of attack's grabbing prey with their tongues, and the meat of toads can be sold for easy money. I've heard that you might get eaten if your equipment's too weak, but since toads hate metal, Kazuma should be safe with his current equipment. I'll protect Aqua and Megumin."
"Eh… The two of them were eaten by toads before, so they've got some psychological trauma about it. They were eaten head first in one gulp and ended up covered in slime, so it can't be helped. Let's find another quest."
Darkness's face turned slightly red after hearing my explanation for some reason.
"… Eaten head first in one gulp… Covered in slime…"
"… Did that make you excited?"
"No way."
Darkness averted her eyes and answered with a red face, making me uneasy.
Would she hunt toads alone if I took my eyes off her?
"The emergency cabbage hunt aside, this is our party's first quest. Let's pick something easy to complete."
Megumin and Darkness went to the bulletin board after hearing my suggestion.
Aqua seemed to be looking down on me after hearing what I said.
"What an introverted hikiNEET… Only Kazuma has the weakest job, so I understand why you're being cautious. But including me, the other members have top-tier jobs! We should take on a bunch of high-difficulty jobs and make lots of money, level up like crazy and take down the Demon King easily! That's why we should take on difficult quests!"
……
"… I really didn't want to say this, but… You haven't been of use so far."
"!"
Aqua was stunned by what I said.
I ignored her and carried on:
"Normally, you should be giving me powerful abilities or equipment, allowing for me to live here without worries. I know that this is a free service provided by the gods, so I didn't want to complain. I was blinded by rage back then, but choosing you instead of an ability was my fault! But you're here in place of those abilities or equipment, and are you performing on par with those special abilities or equipment? Are you? You were acting so great and confident in the beginning, but you've totally not been of use, you former something."
"Ugh… No, not former. Um… In principle, I'm still a goddess…"
Aqua looked down but she still argued with me, my voice turned louder.
"Goddess!? What should a goddess be doing!? Guiding the hero to fight the Demon King and sealing the Demon King before the hero's strong enough to take him on! And what'd you do during the cabbage hunt!? You did grab a lot toward the end, but you were spinning around because of them and threw a tantrum on the floor, right? Even vegetables can make you cry! Are you really a goddess!? Are you really qualified to call yourself a goddess!? Your only contribution's getting eaten by a toad and party tricks!"
"Wah, wahhh–!"
Seeing Aqua hide her face on the table crying out loud made me feel satisfied over the fact that she was looking down on me.
But Aqua didn't want to give up.
She raised her head and retorted with pride.
"I-I'm useful, all right? Like healing spells and healing spells or healing spells! What, you're just a hikiNEET! If you continue to play around, how long do you think it'll take to defeat the Demon King? If you've got something to say, spit it out!"
Aqua raised her head and glared at me with tearing eyes.
I sneered at Aqua.
"I'm a professional gamer who didn't go to high school at all, you think I have nothing to say about this situation?"
"You're a pro gamer?"
"… It sounds better this way, so listen up, Aqua. I don't have the special power of the protagonists in stories, but I have the knowledge of Japan. So I want to sell Japanese products that can be created easily and aren't available in this world. Think about it: my luck stat's so high that even the counter lady suggested that I should become a merchant, right? So I think I shouldn't force myself to take on the work of adventurers, but find another way. It'll be easier to gain experience points if I have more money, right? There are ingredients that make you stronger just by being eaten, like those cabbages."
The other Japanese had the same knowledge as me, but unlike me, they had special powers granted by the gods.
Those people wouldn't need to do something as bothersome as starting a business; they'd stick to the basics and earn a living through quests.
What I wanted to say was that it was hard for me to earn money as an adventurer.
The only quests I took on were hunting toads and cabbages. But judging from the contents of other quests, the rewards were too small and not worth the effort.
I felt the value of life was too low in this world.
I did mention the Demon King before Aqua, but to be honest I'd given up on that. That was why I'd been wondering what the easiest way of earning money quickly was.
"That's how it is, so you think about it too! Think of a business that can earn cash easily and teach me your only good point which is healing magic! I want to learn healing spells after getting more skill points!"
"No–! I won't teach you healing magic! No way–! Don't snatch away the reason for my existence! You'll be fine without learning it with me around! No, I don't want to–!"
After this, Aqua put her face down onto the table crying that I shouldn't take away the only reason for her existence.
At this moment, Megumin and Darkness returned to us.
"… What are you two doing…? The attack power of Kazuma's words are strong. If you don't hold back and shoot your mouth off, most girls would cry!"
"If you accumulate too much stress… I could take Aqua's place and endure your scolding, so lecture me all you want. Don't hold back… As a Crusader, suffering for others is a merit."
The two of them looked at Aqua, who was crying on the table.
She probably knew she was the center of attention. Aqua would peek at me through her fingers from time to time, which irked me.
"Ignore this fellow for now, but…"
I took a glance at Darkness.
"… Darkness-san, you look thinner when you wear your armour…"
Darkness wore a tight black skirt and tank top with leather boots.
With a giant sword on her back, she looked more like a swordswoman than a knight.
She was surrounded by monsters during the cabbage hunt and her armour was damaged, so it was sent in for repair.
I became polite toward Darkness who was wearing so little.
Darkness had a great curvaceous figure.
Simply said, she was rather sexy.
And with Megumin beside her, it accentuated her body type and size.
I couldn't help but think that with such a pretty face and great figure, maybe I could close one eye to her fetish…
"… Hmm? Did you mean to say, 'Are you trying to tempt men with your body, you sow!', right?"
"No."
I glanced at Aqua and Megumin…
… I confirmed once again that no matter how pretty her face was, it was the personality that was the most important.
Megumin said:
"Hey, what'd you mean with that glance? I want to hear it."
"It doesn't mean anything, I'm just glad I'm not a lolicon."
"Crimson Demons would gladly take on anyone wanting a fight. Good, let's take this outside."
Megumin tugged hard at the sleeves of my gym clothes, attempting to pull me outside.
"Back on topic, how about choosing a quest that can help Aqua level up?"
Darkness asked:
"What do you mean? Is there such a quest?"
For Aqua, the skills she needed had been learned from the very beginning, so there wasn't any need to grind her level.
"It's normally hard for clerics to level up, they lack offensive spells after all. They won't fight on the front lines like warriors or defeat enemies with powerful magic, so the best monsters for clerics to grind are the undead. Undead are a race that go against the nature of the gods, so the power of the gods will cause opposite reactions on them. Using healing magic will make their bodies break down."
Ah, I did hear something like that before.
This was common knowledge in many games.
Healing magic had the same effect as offensive magic against the undead.
But this useless goddess wouldn't amount to anything even if we grind her levels…
… I had a stroke of inspiration.
When I leveled up, all my stats got higher.
What about Aqua?
The idiot pretending to cry and sneaking glances at me from time to time might get smarter after leveling up, which was the best way to improve our combat potential.
"Yes, that seems great. The problem is that Darkness's armour isn't ready…"
Darkness crossed her arms and announced frankly:
"I'm fine with it, my full set of defensive skills aren't just for show. Even without armour, I dare say that I'm harder than an adamantoise. And it feels better without armour when I get hit."
"… You just said it feels great to get hit."
"… No I didn't."
"Yes you did."
"I didn't… The only question is whether Aqua's willing…"
Darkness looked at Aqua, who was lying face down on the table.
"Hey, how long are you going to cry? Participate in the conversation, we're talking about your level…"
I reached out and patted Aqua's shoulders…
… But I realized before patting her.
"… Snore…"
Aqua got tired from crying and was sleeping.
Is this goddess a 3-year-old kid?

On a hill, far away from town.
There was a public cemetery for poor and homeless people.
The dead were buried in this world.
A hole would be dug and they'd be covered with earth.
Our quest this time was defeating the undead monsters that were emerging from the cemetery.
It was almost evening.
We set up a tent near the cemetery and waited for night to fall.
"Slow down, Kazuma, I saw that meat first! Here, the vegetable on this side's done, so eat this instead!"
"After the cabbage hunt, I don't like eating vegetables anymore. I'm afraid of the vegetable flying off somewhere if I grill it."
We set up a hot plate some distance away from the cemetery, barbecuing as we waited for dusk.
We spent the time leisurely, even though it was a hunting quest because the target was a small fry known as a zombie maker.
It was an evil spirit that controlled zombies, possessing high-quality corpses while manipulating several zombies as minions.
This monster could be defeated by a novice party, so we took on this quest.
So even though Darkness didn't have her armour, it wasn't too dangerous for her.
After finishing our meal, I poured coffee powder into a mug, added water with Create Water, and used the Tinder spell to heat the mug.
This was Basic Magic taught to me by a mage I met during the cabbage hunt.
As its name suggested, Tinder was a spell to light a fire and posed no offensive threat.
But, to me, it was an important spell that could replace a lighter.
Megumin looked at me with a complicated expression and held out her cup.
"… Excuse me, please give me some water. I feel that Kazuma's more proficient than me in using magic. No one uses basic spells, but you make it look convenient."
I cast Create Water into Megumin's cup.
"Is that so, isn't this the way to use basic spells? Oh right, Create Earth! … Hey, what's this spell used for?"
I showed Megumin the dusty earth on my palm.
There were all sorts of basic elemental spells, but I wasn't sure how to utilize this earth elemental magic.
"Well, the crops grown from magically created earth are high in quality… That's it."
After listening to Megumin's explanation, Aqua beside me burst into laughter.
"What, Kazuma wants to plow the land? Are you changing jobs to a farmer? You could use Create Water for the plants too! This job's a great fit for you, puhehe!"
I faced Aqua with my right palm and raised my left hand.
"Wind Breath!"
"Puhe, ahhh! Ah–! My eyes!"
A gust of wind blew the dust onto Aqua's face; the goddess rolled on the ground after the sand got into her eyes.
"… I got it, so that's how you use this spell."
"No, normal people don't use it that way! And why are you using basic spells better than a mage!?"

"… It's getting cold. Hey Kazuma, our quest's to take down the zombie maker, right? I have a feeling it won't be a small fry, but a big shot undead."
It was late at night and the moon had risen.
Aqua had commented suddenly.
"… Hey, don't say such ominous things. What if you really jinx the quest? Our quest for the day's to defeat one zombie maker and return the zombies to dust. We can then go back to the stables and sleep. We'll also go back immediately if anything out of the ordinary happens. Understand?"
Everyone nodded and agreed with me.
It was about time.
We walked toward the cemetery with me in the lead as I'd learned Enemy Detection from Chris.
Aqua's words made me worry. But this goddess always said unpleasant things, so it shouldn't be a big deal.
… Probably.
… Hmm?
"What's this, I feel a strong presence. It should be the effect of Enemy Detection. Enemies ahead. 1, 2 3, 4…?"
… Strange, there were too many.
I heard there should be just 2 or 3 zombie minions around a zombie maker.
But this was still within the margin of error…
As I was thinking that, blue and white lights suddenly shone from the middle of the cemetery.
… What was happening?
That white light seemed evil and fantasy-like.
The clearly visible blue light was a giant magic circle.
At the edge of the magic circle was a figure in black robes.
"… Hmm? I think… That isn't a zombie maker…"
Megumin said unconfidently.
Beside the black-robed figure were several fluttering shadows.
"Are we going in? Even if that isn't a zombie maker, anyone staying in the cemetery at this hour's probably an undead. If that's the case, then it wouldn't be a problem with Archpriest Aqua around."
Darkness took out her sword and appeared anxious to move on.
Calm down, you.
Aqua made an exaggerated action now.
"Ah–!"
I didn't know what the suddenly shouting Aqua was thinking as she charged at the robed figure.
"Wait! Hey, wait up!"
The charging Aqua ignored me and rushed toward the figure, pointing at it with her finger.
"How dare you show up here, lich! I'll take care of you!"
Lich.
On par with vampires, they were top-tier among the undead.
High-level mages could desert their mortal bodies through magical arts and become the immortal known as the 'overlord of death'.
Unlike the undead monster that rose because of strong grudges, a lich twisted the order of nature and were existences which defied the gods.
A powerful monster akin to a final boss…
"Stop, stop–! Who are you? Where'd you come from and why are you destroying my magic circle? Stop! Please stop?"
"You're noisy, shut up undead! You must be thinking of using this suspicious magic circle for devious means, I'll stomp it! Stomp!"
The powerful monster grabbed onto Aqua's waist in tears, attempting to stop her from stepping on the magic circle.
The minions beside the lich didn't move in to stop the two of them wrestling with each other and just blankly stood there, watching them.
… Eh–what should I do?
In any case, she didn't seem to be a zombie maker.
Aqua claimed that the person she was entangled with was a lich, but the way I saw it, she was just a pitiful passerby being picked on by a hooligan.
"Stop–! Please stop–! This magic circle's used to send the wandering spirits to heaven! Look! The spirits are floating from the magic circle toward the sky, right?"
Just as the lich said, lots of wisp-like, bluish-white objects that came from nowhere drifted into the magic circle and were rising up into the sky along with the light of the magic circle.
"You're acting too arrogant for a lich! An Archpriest like me will perform such benevolent acts, so just scram! You're taking too much time, watch me purify the whole cemetery along with you!"
"Eh? Wait, stop!"
The lich started to panic when she heard Aqua's words.
But Aqua ignored her, opened her arms and shouted:
"Turn Undead–!"
A white light encompassed the entire cemetery with Aqua in the middle.
The light seemed to be gushing out from Aqua's body, and caused the zombies around the lich to vanish upon contact.
It was the same with the spirits gathering at the magic circle of the lich, they disappeared when Aqua's light reached them. The lich was also basked in that light…
"Hya–! My, my body's fading! Stop, my body's disappearing! I'll be purified!"
"Ha, foolish lich! Your existence goes against the law of nature, an undead which defies the will of the gods! Disappear, be vanquished by my power!"
"Hey, stop it!"
I stood behind Aqua and knocked the back of her head with the hilt of my sword.
"…! That hurts! Why'd you hit me!?"
Her focus was broken when the back of her head was hit and she stopped emitting light, held her head and scolded me with tearing eyes.
Darkness and Megumin caught up to us. I ignored Aqua and spoke to the lich, which was trembling while curled up in a ball.
"Hey, are you fine? Um… May I address you as 'Lich'?"
Looking closely, the feet of the lich had turned translucent and were on the verge of disappearing.
Her feet slowly became opaque again and the lich stood up unsteadily with teary eyes.
"I-I-I'm fine… Thank, thank you for saving me from that crisis…! Um, you're right, I'm a lich. My name's Wiz."
After that, she took off the hood she was wearing. Under the moonlight, she seemed to be a beautiful, brown haired woman around twenty years of age.
I thought a lich would have a skull-like face.
Wiz wore a black robe in the style of an evil witch.
No, since she was a lich… She was an evil witch, right?
"Eh, Wiz? What are you doing in this cemetery? You said you wanted to send the spirits to heaven… Now, I don't want to agree with Aqua, but that shouldn't be what a lich like you should be doing, right?"
"What are you doing Kazuma!? Be careful or you'll get contaminated and turn into an undead! Let me cast Turn Undead on her!"
Aqua became agitated after hearing what I said and wanted to cast a spell on Wiz.
Wiz hid behind me with a troubled and terrified expression.
"B-Because as you can see… I'm a lich, the overlord of the undying. As the overlord, I can hear the voices of the spirits wandering in the world. Most of the spirits in this public cemetery don't have money and didn't have a proper burial, so they couldn't move on to the afterlife and haunted the cemetery every night. Since I'm an overlord, I'd visit periodically and send the children on their way."
… My eyes were tearing up.
What a good person.
Apart from the counter lady, she was probably the first normal person I met since coming to this world.
Ah, though I guess she was technically not a human.
"I think that's a wonderful thing, but… Although I'm not Aqua, wouldn't it be better to leave this to the priest in this town?"
In response to my query, Wiz was hesitant to speak as she peeked at the unhappy Aqua, finally saying:
"B-Because… The priests in this town are materialistic… Eh, no. I mean… The rites for those without money would be pushed down their waiting list… Something like that…"
It was probably hard to say it in the presence of the Archpriest Aqua.
"You mean the priests in this town are people who worship money? The public cemetery which is full of poor people is basically ignored by them, right?"
"W-Well, that's how it is…"
Everyone gazed at Aqua silently while she averted her eyes from everyone.
"Since that's the case, then it can't be helped. But could you stop animating the zombies? We're here because of a quest to defeat the zombie maker."
Wiz was troubled by what I said.
"Ah, I see. But I didn't animate them, the corpses that are intact would rise automatically due to my magic every time I come. Um, I won't have any reason to visit if the spirits in the cemetery don't wander anymore and return to heaven… So, how should we resolve this?"

We left the cemetery and were journeying back to town.
"I can't accept this!"
Aqua was still fuming.
Dawn was just about to break.
"It couldn't be helped; she was such a nice person. You couldn't bear to kill her, right?"
We decided to let that lich off.
At the same time, we came to a consensus for the idle Aqua to purify the cemetery periodically.
Fortunately, no matter how bad Aqua was, she still was a goddess. She knew that purifying the undead and wandering spirits was her job.
But she threw a tantrum because her sleeping time would be reduced.
Megumin and Darkness were hesitant about letting a monster off, but they agreed after learning Wiz had never attacked a human before.
I looked at the paper Wiz gave to me and said:
"But for a lich to live normally in town, the security's really lacking."
The piece of paper had Wiz's address on it.
That lich seemed to be living life as a normal human in our town.
She even said she was running a small magic item shop.
I told her my impression of liches dwelling in dungeons and she replied that it wasn't convenient and there was no reason to live there.
Liches were once humans too, so I knew what she meant.
I did understand, but since coming to this world my fantasies about alternate worlds have been shattered.
This wasn't the kind of world I was hoping for.
"We were lucky things turned out so well in the end. Even with Aqua here, the opponent was still a lich. If we really had fought, Kazuma and I would definitely be dead."
Hearing Megumin say that nonchalantly, I was stunned.
"Eh, are liches such dangerous monsters? Would it have been a tough fight?"
"It's much worse than that! Liches have a high magic defense, so nothing can harm her except enchanted weapons. She can trigger all sorts of abnormal statuses just by touching her enemies, and she can also drain their life and mana; she's a legendary immortal monster. What surprised me was that Aqua's Turn Undead had such a great effect on such a powerful being."
I almost lost control of my bowels.
That was right, she was the boss of the undead after all.
When I heard she was willing to teach me the skills of a lich, I took her name card gleefully. When I visit her to learn new skills, I must remember to bring Aqua along.
"Kazuma, give me the name card. I want to set up a holy barrier around the home of that woman and make her cry."
"Please let her go."
On second thought, it'd be better not to take Aqua along…
As we were thinking about that, Darkness said quietly:
"By the way, what about the quest to defeat the zombie maker?"
"Ah."
Quest failed.
